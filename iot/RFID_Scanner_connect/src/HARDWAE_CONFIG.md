## 2. Pin Configuration Details

### I2C Bus (Shared for both LCDs)
The I2C bus is used for communication with the LCD displays. Pull-up resistors are required for stable operation.

| ESP32 Pin | Connection        | Notes                               |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **GPIO 22** | **SCL** (Both LCDs) | Requires a 4.7k立 pull-up to 3.3V    |
| **GPIO 21** | **SDA** (Both LCDs) | Requires a 4.7k立 pull-up to 3.3V    |

### SPI Bus (Shared for all RFID Readers)
The SPI bus is shared by all three MFRC522 modules. Each module is selected using its unique Slave Select (SS) pin.

| ESP32 Pin | Connection          |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **GPIO 18** | **SCK** (All RC522s)  |
| **GPIO 23** | **MOSI** (All RC522s) |
| **GPIO 19** | **MISO** (All RC522s) |

## 3. Important Setup & Wiring Notes

1.  **Power Connections:**
    - All modules must share a **common ground (GND)**.
    - The **ESP32** is powered by a **5V** supply connected to the `VIN` pin.
    - The **RC522 modules** and **I2C pull-up resistors** are powered by the **3.3V** output from the ESP32's `3V3` pin.
    - The **LCDs** can be powered by **5V**.

2.  **Button Wiring:**
    - The code configures the button pins with an internal pull-up resistor (`INPUT_PULLUP`).
    - Wire each button to connect its assigned GPIO pin to **GND** when pressed. No external resistors are needed for the buttons.

3.  **RFID Reader Setup:**
    - The **RST (Reset)** and **IRQ (Interrupt)** pins on the MFRC522 modules are **not used** in this project's code. They can be left disconnected.
    - Keep the SPI bus wires (SCK, MOSI, MISO) as short as possible to minimize signal interference.

4.  **I2C LCD Setup:**
    - Ensure the I2C addresses of your LCD modules are set to `0x27` (for the 16x02) and `0x26` (for the 16x04). These can usually be changed via jumpers or by soldering pads on the I2C backpack.
    - The 4.7k立 pull-up resistors on the SDA and SCL lines are critical for reliable communication. Some modules have them built-in, but it's best to add them externally if you face issues.

5.  **Safety First:**
    - Always double-check all wiring connections before applying power.
    - Verify you are connecting components to the correct voltage (3.3V vs. 5V) to prevent damage.

6.  **LCD Library Modification (16x4 Display):**
    - The `LiquidCrystal_I2C` library in this project has been **modified** to work correctly with the specific 16x04 LCD module used.
    - If you experience issues with the 16x04 display (e.g., text appearing on the wrong lines), you may need to adjust the `row_offsets` in the library file: `lib\LiquidCrystal_I2C\LiquidCrystal_I2C.cpp`.
    - For this project, the `setCursor` function was updated with the following line:
      `int row_offsets[] = { 0x00, 0x40, 0x10, 0x50 };`
