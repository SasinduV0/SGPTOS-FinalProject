# SGPTOS-FinalProject
**Smart Garment Production Tracking & Optimization System**  
Final Year Project – National Diploma in Technology (Information Technology)

---

## 📌 Introduction
The **Smart Garment Production Tracking & Optimization System (SGPTOS)** is developed for the garment manufacturing industry to enhance efficiency, improve quality control, and streamline production monitoring through modern technology.

The system integrates **RFID-based tracking**, **IoT-enabled machine monitoring**, **real-time analytics**, and **automated quality control** to address inefficiencies caused by manual, paper-based processes.

---

## 📜 Background
The garment industry faces challenges such as:
- Lack of **real-time production visibility**.
- Manual tracking errors.
- Delays in identifying bottlenecks.
- Ineffective labor performance monitoring.
- Poor quality control procedures.

Example Case: **Zig Zag Garment Factory – Nugegoda, Colombo** relied on manual systems, leading to inefficiencies and limited insight into operations.

---

## 🎯 Motivation
Key drivers for developing SGPTOS:
- Eliminate production delays due to insufficient tracking.
- Improve **labor productivity monitoring** and accountability.
- Enable **predictive maintenance** for machinery.
- Implement **systematic quality defect tracking**.
- Reduce operational costs through automation.

---

## ❗ Problem Identification
Current manual processes cause:
- Inability to track real-time production progress.
- Lost garments during production stages.
- Unfair or inaccurate worker performance reviews.
- Quality inconsistencies and difficulty tracing defects.

---

## 🎯 Aim
> To optimize garment production efficiency by implementing an RFID-based tracking system with labor monitoring, IoT-enabled machine performance tracking, and real-time analytics — enhancing workflow visibility, improving quality control, and minimizing delays and costs.
